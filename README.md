- ## Hi there I'm Eol Nuha, a **Frontend Developer at Gjirafa, Inc.**

I am a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a tech freak obsessed with the latest devices. Currently I am working as a Frontend Developer at Gjirafa, developing a Video Platform website for Gjirafa and its customers. I am also the CEO and main content writer of **[Eol Nuha Blogs](https://eolnuha.com/blog/)**, where I work part-time and publish programming content and tutorials. 
I've done a variety of projects where I've put most of them as public repositories in this Github profile (inlcuding the source code to my blog website).
I am always looking to connect with other fellow Software Engineers, so please don't hesitate to contact me.

Here are some of the places where you can find me:
